एक दिन, एक आमिर युवा शासक यीशु के पास आया और उनसे पूछा की “हे उत्तम गुरु, अनन्त जीवन का वारिस होने के लिए में क्या करू?” Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? There is only One who is good, and that is God. But if you want to have eternal life, obey God’s laws.”

“Which ones?” he asked. Jesus replied, “Do not murder. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not lie. Honor your father and mother, and love your neighbor as you love yourself.”

The young man, trying to prove that he was right, said, “I have obeyed all these laws ever since I was a boy. What do I still need to do?” Jesus looked at him and loved him.

Jesus answered, “If you want to be perfect, then go and sell everything you own and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure waiting for you in heaven. Then come and follow me.”

When the young man heard this, he became very sad, because he was very rich. He turned and went away from Jesus, unwilling to give up his wealth.

Then Jesus said to his disciples, “How hard it is for rich people to enter into the Kingdom of God! Yes, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God.”

When the disciples heard this they were shocked and said, “Then who can be saved?”

Jesus looked at them and said, “With people this is impossible, but with God, all things are possible.”

Peter said to Jesus, “We have left everything and followed you. What will be our reward?”

Jesus answered, “Everyone who has left houses, brothers, sisters, father, mother, children, or property for my name’s sake, will inherit 100 times more in the next world and also eternal life. But many who are first will be last, and those who are last will be first.”
