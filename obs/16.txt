यहोशू के मरने के बाद, इस्राएलियों ने परमेश्वर की आज्ञा का पालन नहीं किया और न ही परमेश्वर के नियमों का पालन किया और न ही बचे हुए कनानियो को बाहर निकाला. इस्राएलियों ने यहोवा जो साचा परमश्वर है उसके स्थान पर, कनानियो के देवता की उपासना करना आरम्भ किया. इस्राएलियों का उस समय कोई राजा न था, इसीलिए हर कोई वही करता था जो उन्हें ठीक लगता था.

क्योंकी इस्राएली निरंतर परमेश्वर का अवहेलना कर रहे थे, इसीलिए परमेश्वर का कोप उन पर भड़क उठा, और उन्हें शत्रुओं के अधीन कर दिया; और वह फिर अपने शत्रुओ के आगे ठहर न सके. इन शत्रुओं ने इस्राएलियों की वस्तुओं को लुट लिया, उनकी संपत्ति को नष्ट कर दिया, और साथ ही उनमें से बहुतों को मार गिराया. कई वर्षों बाद, इस्राएलियों ने पश्चाताप किया और परमेश्वर से कहा की वह उन्हें बचाए.

तौभी परमेश्वर उनके लिए न्यायी ठहराता था जो उन्हें लूटने वाले के हाथ से छुड़ाते थे. परन्तु लोग परमेश्वर को भूलने लगे और पराये देवताओं के पीछे चलकर उनकी उपासना करने लगे. तो परमेश्वर ने पास के ही एक शत्रुओं के समूह मिद्यानियों को अनुमति दी की वह उन्हें पराजित करे .

They took all of the Israelites’ crops for seven years. The Israelites were so scared, they hid in caves so the Midianites would not find them. Finally, they cried out to God to save them.

One day, a man named Gideon was secretly harvesting grain so the Midianites would not steal it. The angel of God came to Gideon and said, “God is with you, mighty warrior. Go and save Israel from the Midianites.”

God told Gideon to tear down his father’s idol. Gideon was afraid of the people, so he waited until nighttime. Then he tore down the idol and smashed it to pieces. He built an altar to God where the idol used to be and made a sacrifice to God.

The next morning the people saw that the idol had been torn down, and they were very angry. They went to Gideon’s house to kill him, but Gideon’s father said, “Why are you trying to help your gods? If they are gods, let them protect themselves!” So Gideon was saved.

Then the Midianites came again to steal from the Israelites. There were so many of them that they could not be counted. Gideon called the Israelites together to fight them. Gideon asked God for two signs so he could be sure that God would use him to save Israel.

First, he laid a cloth on the ground and asked God to let the morning dew fall only on the cloth and not on the ground. God did that. The next night, he asked that the ground be wet but the cloth dry. God did that too.

32,000 Israelite soldiers came to Gideon, but God told him this was too many. So Gideon sent home 22,000 who were too scared to fight. God told Gideon that he still had too many men. So Gideon sent all of them home except for 300 soldiers.

That night God told Gideon, “Go down to the Midianite camp and when you hear what they say, you will no longer be afraid.” So that night, Gideon went down to the camp and heard a Midianite soldier telling his friend about a dream. The man’s friend said, “This dream means that Gideon will defeat Midian!” Gideon worshiped God.

Then Gideon returned to his soldiers and gave each of them a horn, a clay pot, and a torch. They surrounded the place where the Midianites were sleeping. The 300 men had the torches in the pots so they could not be seen.

Then, at the same time, they all broke the pots that were hiding the torches. They blew their horns and shouted, “A sword for God and for Gideon!”

God confused the Midianites, so that they attacked each other and started killing each other. Immediately, the rest of the Israelites were called from their homes to come help chase the Midianites. They killed many of them and chased the rest of them out of their land. 120,000 Midianites died that day. God had saved Israel.

The people wanted to make Gideon their king. Gideon wisely refused their offer, but he asked them for some of the money that each of them had taken from the enemy. Gideon received a lot of money.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-16-16.jpg?direct&}}

Then Gideon did a foolish thing. He made an idol with the money, and the people turned away from God again. They started worshiping Gideon’s idol.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-16-17.jpg?direct&}}

God punished Israel again for worshiping idols. Their enemies defeated them. They finally asked God for help, and God sent them another deliverer. This pattern of sin, punishment, repentance, and deliverance was repeated many times. God sent many deliverers who saved Israel from their enemies.

Finally, the people asked God for a king like all the other nations had. They wanted a king who was tall, strong, and could lead them into battle. God did not like this request, but He gave them what they wanted.
