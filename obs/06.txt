जब अब्राहम वृद्ध हो गया था, तो उसका पुत्र इसहाक व्यस्कता कि और बढता जा रहा था, अब्राहम ने अपने एक दास से कहा, कि तू मेरे देश में मेरे ही कुटुम्बियों के पास जाकर मेरे पुत्र इसहाक के लिए एक पत्नी ले आएगा |

She agreed to leave her family and go back with the servant. Isaac married her as soon as she arrived.

After a long time, Abraham died and all of the promises that God had made to him in the covenant were passed on to Isaac. But Isaac’s wife, Rebekah, could not have children. Isaac could not be the father of many nations if he did not even have a son.

Isaac prayed for Rebekah, and God allowed her to get pregnant with twins.

Before they were born, God told Rebekah that the older son would serve the younger one.

When they were born, the older son came out red and hairy—they named him Esau. The younger son had smooth skin, and they named him Jacob.
