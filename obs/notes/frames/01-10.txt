===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **took some dirt**  - God made man from the dust, or dry dirt from the ground. This word should probably be different from the general word used for earth.
  * **formed it**  - This word expresses that God personally fashioned the man, comparing this to how a person creates something with his hands. Make sure that a different word from "create" is used. Note that this is very different from how he created everything else through a simple spoken command.
  * **a man**  - Only the man was created at this time; the woman was created later by a different method.
  * **breathed life**  - This phrase expresses God's very personal, intimate action as he transferred life from himself into Adam's body, comparing this to how a human being breathes out air.
  * **life**  - In this event, God breathed both physical and spiritual life into the man.
  * **Adam**  - Adam's name is the same as the Old Testament word for "man," and similar to the word for "dirt" from which he was formed.
  * **garden**  - An area of land planted with trees and plants for a purpose–usually to produce food or to provide beauty.
  * **care for it**  - To maintain the garden by tending, weeding, watering, harvesting, planting, etc.
