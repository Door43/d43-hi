जल्द ही **गड़रिये** उस जगह पहुँच गए जहाँ **यीशु** था, और उन्होंने उसे एक चरनी में पाया, ठीक जैसा कि स्वर्गदूत ने उन्हें बताया था।They were very excited. **[[:en:key-terms:mary|Mary]]** was very happy, too. The shepherds returned to the fields where their sheep were, **[[:en:key-terms:praise|praising]]** **[[:en:key-terms:god|God]]** for **all they had heard and seen**.
===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **all they had heard and seen**  - That is, “for everything they had heard and seen.” This included the glorious angels and their amazing message, as well as seeing the newborn Messiah himself.
