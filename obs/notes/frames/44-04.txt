A crowd of people quickly came to see the man who was **[[:en:key-terms:heal|healed]]**. **[[:en:key-terms:peter|Peter]]** said to them, â€œWhy are you amazed that this man is healed? We did not heal him through our own power or goodness. Rather, it is the **[[:en:key-terms:power|power]]** of **[[:en:key-terms:jesus|Jesus]]** and the **[[:en:key-terms:faith|faith]]** that Jesus gives that healed this man."
