सब चीज़ों का आरंभ कुछ इस प्रकार हुआ। [[:hi:key-terms:god|परमेश्वर]] ने छः दिन के भीतर **ब्रह्माण्ड** और उसके भीतर की सभी चीज़ों की **रचना** की। परमेश्वर द्वारा सृष्टि किये जाने बाद पृथ्वी **अंधियारी** और **खाली** थी, और इसके भीतर **किसी भी चीज़** की रचना नहीं हुई थी। लेकिन जल के ऊपर **[[:hi:key-terms:holy-spirit|परमेश्वर का आत्मा]]** था।

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the beginning**  - That is, "the beginning of all things," before anything existed except God.
  * **created**  - This is used here in the sense of making something out of nothing.
  * **universe**  - This includes everything that God created on the earth and in the heavens, both visible and invisible things.
  * **dark**  - It was completely dark. There was no light at all, since God had not yet created light.
  * **empty**  - God had not yet created anything except for the bare earth covered by water.
  * **nothing had been formed**  - There were no distinguishing features–just water covering everything.
  * **God's Spirit**  - The Spirit of God, sometimes called the Holy Spirit, was present in the beginning, moving freely over the earth in order to create all that he had planned to do.
