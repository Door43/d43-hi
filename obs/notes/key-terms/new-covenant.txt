====== नई वाचा ======

===== परिभाषा : =====

अपने नबी मूसा के माध्यम से परमेश्वर ने इस्राएल के साथ वाचा बाँधी, और बाद में एक नई वाचा बनाने की प्रतिज्ञा की।

  *

पुरानी वाचा से नई वाचा बेहतर है, क्योंकि यह सबके पापों के लिए यीशु के दिए बलिदान पर आधारित है।

  *

This New Covenant came into effect when God's Son died and came back to life.

  *

Believers keep the New Covenant by trusting God to forgive them and save them because of the sacrificial death and resurrection of Jesus.

  *

God writes the New Covenant on the hearts of believers. As a result of this, Christians want to obey God, and they begin to live holy lives that demonstrate that God is working in them.

  *

The New Covenant will be fulfilled when God establishes his reign on earth. Everything will once again be very good, as it was at creation. There will be no more sin, suffering, or injustice. Instead, all of God's people will dwell with him in peace, love, and harmony.

**[[https://door43.org/en/obs/notes/frames/21-05|[21-05]]]** Through the prophet Jeremiah, God promised that he would make a **New Covenant**, but not like the covenant God made with Israel at Sinai. In the **New Covenant**, God would write his law on the people's hearts, the people would know God personally, they would be his people, and God would forgive their sins. The Messiah would start the **New Covenant**.

**[[https://door43.org/en/obs/notes/frames/21-14|[21-14]]]** Through the Messiah's death and resurrection, God would accomplish his plan to save sinners and start the **New Covenant**.
