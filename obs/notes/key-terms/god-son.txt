====== Son of God, the Son ======

===== Facts: =====

The Son of God is Jesus, who came into the world as a human being to save and rule the world.

  *

The Son of God has the same nature as God the Father, and is therefore fully God.

  *

God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit are all of one essence.

  *

Unlike human sons, the Son of God has always existed.

  *

In the beginning, the Son of God was active in creating the world, along with the Father and the Holy Spirit.

  *

Because Jesus is God's Son, he loves and obeys his Father, and his Father loves him.

  *

It is best to translate “Son” with the same word the language would naturally use to refer to a “son” of a human father.
