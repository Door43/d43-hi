When a person repents of his sin and trusts Jesus to forgive him, that person receives “eternal life.” Nothing will ever separate that person from God–not even death. He will enjoy life in God's presence forever.

In the Bible, to receive “eternal life” is to be “saved” from sin and death.

Sometimes this is translated as, “everlasting life” or, “living forever.”
