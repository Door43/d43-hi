“Church” could be translated as a “gathering together” or “assembly” of believers. The word “congregation” has a similar meaning. However, the believers are still the “church” even when they are not together.

  *

In the Bible, the word “church” always refers to Christian believers, and never to a building.

  *

The church meets together to pray, teach God's truth, and encourage each other to live in a way that is pleasing to God.

  *

God also calls his people, the Church, to go out and teach the good message about Jesus.
