पौलुस एक यहूदी था और रोमी नगर ‘‘तरशुश’’ में पैदा हुआ था, और इसलिये वह एक रोमी नागरिक भी था।

Saul became a Jewish religious leader and arrested Jews who became Christians because he did not believe in Jesus.

Jesus came to Saul in a blinding light and told him to stop hurting Christians. Jesus then sent a Christian man to teach Saul, and Saul believed in Jesus.

  *

At first, Saul taught Jews about Jesus.

  *

Later, God sent Saul to teach other people groups about Jesus in many Roman cities. Then he started using the Roman name, Paul.

  *

Paul also wrote letters to encourage and teach Christians in various cities. Some of his letters are in the Bible.
