==== What to Know Before Translation ====

It is recommended that you consult the [[hi:ta:vol1:translate:toc_transvol1_2|Translation Manual]] frequently as you translate this content. Before you start translating, we recommend that you start working your way through the Translation Manual at least until you know the difference between a literal translation and a meaning-based translation. Much of the rest of the Translation Manual can be used as a "just-in-time" learning resource.

Some important subjects that must be learned before starting a translation project:
  * [[hi:ta:vol1:translate:guidelines_intro]] - The definition of a good translation
  * [[hi:ta:vol1:translate:translate_process]] - How a good translation is made
    * [[hi:ta:vol1:translate:translate_fandm]] - The difference between form and meaning
    * [[hi:ta:vol1:translate:translate_dynamic]] - How to make a meaning-based translation

Some other important topics as you get started include:
  * [[hi:ta:vol1:translate:translate_what]] - Suggestions for where to start translating
  * [[hi:ta:vol1:translate:first_draft]] - How to make a first draft
  * [[hi:ta:vol1:translate:translate_help]] - Using translation helps



Next we recommend you learn about:
  * //[[hi:ta:vol1:translate:choose_team|Choosing a Translation Team]]//
  * //[[hi:ta:vol1:translate:translate_source_text|Choosing a Source Text]]//
  * //[[hi:ta:vol1:translate:translate_alphabet|Alphabet/Orthography]]//
  * //[[hi:ta:vol1:translate:writing_decisions|Decisions for Writing Your Language]]//
  * //[[hi:ta:vol1:translate:translate_what|What to Start Translating]]//
